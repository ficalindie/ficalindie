  ## 🤖 FICAL repos 
  * [Customisable PC screensaver](https://github.com/ficalindie/ficalindie_screensaver/tree/main), ficalindie branded 😎
  * [ChatCuddhi](https://github.com/ficalindie/ChatCuddhi), a very first attempt in creating a dumb chatbot able to translate from griko (ancient Salento's dialect) to italian.


  ## 💡 What does "Ficalindie" mean?
  Ficalindie is the word for prickly pear leaves in our local [Salentinian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salento) dialect. They are one of the most unique local "dogmas", 
  a fresh and sweet fruit that can be enjoyed along with its pads (nopales), which are also edible. Ficalindie help people of all ages to sustain a simple yet efficient diet. Moreover, they can be found anywhere in Salento and you can eat them for free, if you account for your hands possibly getting crushed by a good amount of spikes. 
  
  Is there any parallel between that and our project? Perhaps.
  
  ## 🌵 About us
  Definying something always ruins its inherent magic, so we will be brief. Ficalindie was created by a group of friends, which are perhaps united by a passion for different niches, including many musical ones.
  
  ## 🌠 Ficalindie Fest
  In 2019, we tried out our first event, "Ficalindie Fest 2019", which was also a meeting for a parallel project and was held in a nice countryside property in [Nardò](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nard%C3%B2). 
  
  In 2022 we followed with, you already know, "Ficalindie Fest 2022", held at [Castello De' Monti](https://www.beniculturalionline.it/location-4663_Castello-De%E2%80%99-Monti-.php).
  
  This year we are back at it again at Castello De' Monti in Corigliano, for "Ficalindie Fest 2023".
  Our vision for this unique event is to create an immersive experience, where art merges with the creativity and expressiveness of the musicians who will be performing live. 

  **_See you there._**
