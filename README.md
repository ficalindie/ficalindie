## 🌵 About us
We are a group of four young people from Corigliano d'Otranto, who have already achieved considerable success with the previous edition of the "Ficalindie Fest 2022" event last year, 
attracting more than 300 people to the suggestive [Castello De' Monti](https://www.beniculturalionline.it/location-4663_Castello-De%E2%80%99-Monti-.php).

Our vision for this unique event is to create an immersive and immersive experience, where AI-generated art merges with the creativity and expressiveness of the musicians who will be performing live. 
Through this interaction between technology and human talent, we intend to offer the public a unique perspective on the connection between traditional art and the new digital frontiers.
